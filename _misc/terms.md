## 4. Acceptable Use

## 5. Intellectual Property

Our Rights: We own all rights, title, and interest in Scrapezoid, including its software, API, and documentation. These Terms do not grant you any ownership rights.

Your Data: You retain ownership of any data you scrape using the Service. We claim no rights to it, though we may collect metadata about your API usage (see our Privacy Policy).

## 6. Termination

By You: You may stop using the Service and cancel your subscription at any time.

By Us: We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, fail to pay subscription fees, or if we discontinue the Service. We’ll notify you where possible.

Effect of Termination: Upon termination, your access to the Service will end, and any outstanding fees remain payable.

## 7. Disclaimers

Scrapezoid is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or suitable for all your purposes. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by Australian law, [Your Company Name] is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months prior to any claim.
