# Scrapezoid

Scrapezoid is a web scraping API that gives you web scraping superpowers.

## Features

### Flexible web scraping modes

Scrapezoid supports 2x different web scraping modes:

1. **Fast mode:** scrape websites like a curl request, with basic anti-blocking.
It's recommended to use this mode for most use cases. If you find that
the website you're scraping is blocking your requests, or you require
Javascript so that the site loads correctly, you can try Javascript mode.
2. **Javascript mode:** scrape websites via a custom headless browser that can
execute Javascript with advanced anti-blocking techniques.
